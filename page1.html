    <p class="title">Early Development of GPUs (1980sâ€“1990s)</p>
    <p class="text">During the 1980s, early graphics processors were created to handle simple 2D graphics tasks, primarily in arcade systems and computers.</p>

    <p class="text">Arcade system boards have used specialized graphics circuits since the 1970s. In early video game hardware, RAM for frame buffers was expensive, so video chips composited data together as the display was being scanned out on the monitor.</p>

        It functions as a co-processor, designed to offload redundant and computationally intensive tasks that require a high degree of concurrency to achieve optimal frame rates in modern 3D graphics.</p>
