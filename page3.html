    <p class="title">GPUs for Parallel Computing (2010s)</p>
    <p class="text">
        In the 2010s, GPUs became central to the emerging field of parallel computing. With their massive parallel processing capabilities, GPUs offered a unique advantage over traditional CPUs for tasks that could be parallelized. This era saw the widespread adoption of GPUs for scientific simulations, deep learning, and cryptocurrency mining.</p><br>

        Frameworks such as CUDA and OpenCL made it easier for developers to harness the power of GPUs for non-graphics tasks. NVIDIA’s Volta and Turing architectures, alongside AMD’s Vega and Navi series, featured hundreds or even thousands of cores, enabling significant performance boosts in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and high-performance computing.</p>
